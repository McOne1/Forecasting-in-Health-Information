# Forecasting-in-Health-Information

The need for a health information application is almost a necessity in coeval time.The
application created namely Forecasting in Health Information aims to provide a quick scope
of disease an individual maybe suffering, in the palm of their hands.Forecasting in health 
information applies various Machine Learning algorithms on data-sets to provide a quick 
and accurate prediction of the disease.The application takes intensity of various symptoms as
an input and feeds the data to pretested algorithm to reveal the possibility of a specific
disease.The application is currently able to predict diseases like malaria, dengue and
meningitis with accuracy from the data provided by the user.Python is used for Machine learning
 coding and the App is Coded in Android studio using Java.Tensorflow library is used to embed the machine
 learning code into the Application.
